          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>David Wilson-Brown is a student of web development, educator, actor, and director.  His approach and work in web development ties directly to his creative process in stage and film.  The end result of a website or app, and a film or play, is ultimately a functional product that successfully fills a need for the user (audience).  They are both born as an idea, and through extensive analysis, testing (rehearsal) and collaboration, are created in hopes to improve the quality of life. 
            <br>
            <br>Along with training in web development from Austin Coding Academy, David holds a Master of Fine Arts in Performance from the University of Wisconsin-Madion and a BFA in Theatre Performance from UT Arlington.</p>
